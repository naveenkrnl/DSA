# daily-goals
Add your daily goals on this simple app and it will push you daily to achieive the same

I wanted to learn Node JS + I wanted to make my personal daily goal assistant.
It works on local server and keeps reminding of your daily goals and pushing you to complete and achieve the same

The app is connected to a online database mongodb
To run on your system , you need to signup <a href="https://cloud.mongodb.com/user#/atlas/register/accountProfile">here</a><br/>
Add the database link you get from there in place of * 5<sup>th</sup> line mongoose.connect("*")

Now to run the Node Js Project on your system
Clone the repository and move into the directory using CLI.
Enter 
<pre>npm install</pre>
Then, after all the dependencies are installed 
Run
<pre>npm start</pre>
or
<pre>nodemon app</pre>
